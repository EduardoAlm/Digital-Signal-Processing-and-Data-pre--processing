# Digital-Signal-Processing-and-Data-pre--processing

These python scripts consist in some experiments in order to improve my knowledge in signal processing and adaptation of matlab scripts to Python. The data used pertains seismic events.

The Downloader and get-data scripts are finished and make easier getting data from platforms such as IRIS.

The other three scripts (forw, stft and main) are still incomplete for the data has been processed, through the use of the stft algorithm ..., but the data final result visualization is still to be done. These three make use of the obspy framework as well as matplotlib, scipy and numpy libraries.

There are also two more scripts one in matlab and another in python that contain a simple code to approximate continuous periodic functions using the fourier series.
